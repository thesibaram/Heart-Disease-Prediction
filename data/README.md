# Data Directory

This folder stores raw and processed data used by the project.

## Structure
- `raw/`: Place the downloaded dataset files here. The project expects a file named `heart_disease_uci.csv` from the [Heart Disease dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data).
- `processed/`: Intermediate and preprocessed datasets generated during the pipeline run.

Please avoid committing actual data files to version control to keep the repository lightweight and compliant with dataset licensing.
